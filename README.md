Mancala Game

Game introduction:

Mancala is a two-player game in which players moves stones around a board, trying to capture as many as possible.
On a player's turn, he or she chooses one of the pits on his or her side of the board(not the mancala) and removes all of the stones from that pit. The player then places one stone in each pit, moving counterclockwise around the board, starting with the pit immediately next to the chosen pit, including his or her Mancala but not the opponent's mancala. If the player's last stone ends in an empty pit on his or her own side, the player captures all of the stones in the pit directly across the board from where the last stone was placed (the opponents stones are removed from the pit and placed in the player's Mancala) as well as the last stone placed(the one placed in the empty pit). The game ends when one player cannot move on his or her turn, at which time the other player captures all of the stones remaining on his or her side of the board.
